# Public-school-safety
We will be creating a python code that will help control entrances in public places.The way we will be doing this is by using motion dectors and cameras. The camera will be used by the security department to see who enters and exits the premise. The sensors will detect any material .05 miles away from the premise. Our purpose of this code is to reduce gun violence in our environment by creating a secure and happy environment for the people. 
Base of recurrence of gun violence in public space during the pass 10 years targeting schools and publics edifices, some states passed a law allowing concealed firearms while in public space. We beleive that it's one step out of many, other options we tought this sensors detectors and cameras will be more efficient.
