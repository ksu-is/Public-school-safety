# Public-school-safety
We will use a Raspberry Pi with python code that will help control entrances in public places. The way we will be doing this is by using motion detectors and cameras. The camera will be used by the security department to see who enters and exits the premise. The sensors will detect any material .05 miles away from the premise. Those sensors will then alert the security department. The purpose of this code is to reduce gun violence in our environment by creating a secure and happy environment for the people. 
Considering the recurrence of gun violence in public space during the pass 10 years targeting schools and publics edifices; some states passed a law allowing concealed firearms. We beleive that it's one step out of many other options such as sensor detectors and cameras which will be more efficient.
